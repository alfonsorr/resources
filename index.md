# Resources

## Working and showing code on cloud.

* [Binder](https://mybinder.org/): Free cloud service to use a repository with jupyter notebooks. It alows to put custom kernels.
For a Scala example using [almond](https://almond.sh) see [here](https://github.com/almond-sh/examples), just copy the "binder" folder and put in your project.
To limit the present kernels, delete the corresponding paragraph at the begining.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/): Free cloud service to use a instance of visual studio with your repository. It allows to install default plugins.
For a updated example for scala see [here](https://github.com/tgodzik/metals-sample). Copy the ".gitpod.yml" file and the files referenced in it.
